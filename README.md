## üöÄ Upgrade Ideas: WebAssembly, New Languages, and More Sorts

### 1. **Move Sorting Algorithms to WebAssembly (Wasm)**

**üîß How:**
- Write the sorting algorithms in **Rust**, **C/C++**, or **Zig**, compile to Wasm.
- Use JavaScript to call the compiled Wasm functions and stream sorting steps back to the UI.

**üí° Why:**
- Super-fast execution.
- Leverage lower-level optimizations (e.g., SIMD) for large datasets.
- A great opportunity to show algorithm performance differences.

**üîÅ Bonus:** In Rust, you can export an iterator that yields each step of the sort for animation purposes.

### 2. **Add More Sorting Algorithms**

**Visual & performance variety:**
- **Merge Sort** ‚Äì good for showing recursion.
- **Heap Sort** ‚Äì visually unique.
- **Radix Sort** ‚Äì good for base-based sorting animation.
- **Bogo Sort** ‚Äì for fun/chaos.

**UI:**
Let the user:
- Pick speed (delay time)
- Choose algorithm
- Select dataset size and shape (random, nearly sorted, reversed)

### 3. **Switch Entirely to Rust + Wasm Frontend (Yew or Leptos)**

**Idea:** Use something like [Yew.rs](https://yew.rs) or [Leptos](https://leptos.dev) (Rust-based web frameworks) to build a **fully client-side** sorting visualizer with Wasm.

**Advantages:**
- No Python server needed.
- Pure Wasm frontend app.
- Ultra-fast sorting even in the browser.

---

### 4. **Real-Time Algorithm Race Mode**

Visualize **two sorting algorithms side-by-side** sorting the same array:
- Two containers show progress in real time.
- Pause, resume, speed up each.
- Graph progress (like steps per second, comparisons, swaps).

---

### 5. **Interactive Sorting Playground**

Let users:
- Manually drag the bars to reorder.
- Step through the sort (next, previous).
- See metrics: comparisons, swaps, execution time.
- Generate worst-case / best-case arrays.

---

### 6. **Use Web Workers or Wasm Threads**

For large sorts, offload computation:
- JavaScript-based Web Workers for non-blocking sorting.
- Wasm with threads (via Rust + wasm-bindgen or C++) to parallelize sorts like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.

---

### 7. **Algorithm as Music**

Convert sorting actions into sound:
- Comparison ‚Üí soft blip
- Swap ‚Üí click or pitch shift
- Completed sort ‚Üí harmony

Combine with Web Audio API for a ‚Äúsorting symphony.‚Äù

---

### 8. **Data-Driven Sorting Challenge Mode**

Gamify it:
- User has to guess which algorithm is being visualized based on animation pattern.
- Or: give the user control to optimize sorting strategy based on input patterns.
